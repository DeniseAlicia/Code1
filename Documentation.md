# What this is about:
This is a personal learning diary for the module *Code 1* of the GMB course. Each day is going to be doucumented on here, including the actual tasks and how they were solved as well as other noteworthy stuff like problems ore roadblocks encountered along the way.


## Day 1
*17.06.2024*

The first task today was to simply set up our coding environment and any other necessary software packages for this course. This entailed:

- Git
- Visual Studio Code (plus extensions ESLint and Git Graph)
- node.js
- Typescript Compiler
  
At first I was worried that I might need to use one of the lab's computers, since I am not really familiar with using the linux environment on my chromebook. But as it turns out, it was not as complicated as I expected. 

Git actually came preinstalled with the linux environment, so that was already taken care of. 

Visual Studio Code was also fairly simple. I simply had to download the correct package for my hardware (linux, x64) and then install them via a single line in the linux terminal.

But node.js and typescript proved more difficult then that.

The next task was to familiarize ourselfs with GitHub. That included setting up an account and a personal *Code1*-repository, as well as team repositories with links to every members peronal repos.
