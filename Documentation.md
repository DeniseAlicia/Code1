# What this is about:
This is a personal learning diary for the module *Code 1* of the GMB course. Each day is going to be doucumented on here, including the actual tasks and how they were solved as well as other noteworthy stuff like problems ore roadblocks encountered along the way.


## Day 1
*17.06.2024*

The first task today was to simply set up our coding environment and any other necessary software packages for this course. This entailed:

- Git
- Visual Studio Code (plus extensions ESLint and Git Graph)
- node.js
- Typescript Compiler
  
At first I was worried that I might need to use one of the lab's computers, since I am not really familiar with using the linux environment on my chromebook. But as it turns out, it was not as complicated as I expected. 

Git actually came preinstalled with the linux environment, so that was already taken care of. 


Visual Studio Code was also fairly simple. I simply had to download the correct package for my hardware (linux, x64) and then install them via a single line in the linux terminal.

But node.js and typescript proved more difficult then that.

The next task was to familiarize ourselfs with GitHub. That included setting up an account and a personal *Code1*-repository, as well as team repositories with links to every members peronal repos.

Visual Studio Code was also fairly simple. I simply had to download the correct package for my hardware (linux, x64) and then install them via a single line in the linux terminal (one google search away).


Next, we had to familiarize ourselfs with GitHub. That included setting up an account as well as a personal *Code1*-Repository (which we are in right now). Additionally, each team had to set up a repository and link their personal repositories within. That taught as a bit about some GitHub basics, like markdown pages, collaborators and why simultaneously working on the same file is complicated (branching).

After that, we cloned our personal repositories into Visual Studio Code and were told to play around with branches, merges and push/pull mechanics. That got us warmed up to some 

## **Vocabulary**

*repository*: a storage environment for programmers to store code and other useful stuff. It makes managing projects easier

*branch*: a version of the code existing simultaneously with other versions of the code. Can be created and merged

*merge (from)*: combining two branches into one. You always merge **from** the branch you want to disappear **into** the branch you want to keep

*commit*: Commiting changes
