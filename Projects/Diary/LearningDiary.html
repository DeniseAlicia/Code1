    <h1> What this is about</h1>
    <div> This is a personal learning diary for the module Code 1 of the GMB course. <br>
         Each day is going to be documented on here, like my own personal script for the lecture </div>
      
    <h2> 
        <strong> Day 1 - Getting Started </strong> <br>

    <h2>
        <strong> Day 4 - Typescript</strong> <br>
        <i> 25.06.2024 </i>
    </h2>

    <p> Typescript is essentially a better version of Javascript, that compiles into Javascript. 
        It allows for more strict type management, for example. This means that you have to be more specific 
        with defining your variables, but also reduces the chance of errors due to conflicting types.</p>
    
    <p> You can link scripts to your html-pages to change properties like texts and colors, as well as handle 
        interactions with the page, like clicking on something. Those are called <b>events</b>.</p>

    <p> For events to be called, an element needs an <b> Event Listener</b>. Those check for events they are assigned 
        to and can call the appropiate function for the event:</p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th> Event Type</th>
            <th> Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td> PointerEvent</td>
            <td> </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
