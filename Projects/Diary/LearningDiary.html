    <h1> What This Is About</h1>
    <div> This is a personal learning diary for the module Code1 of the GMB course. <br>
        Each day is going to be documented on here, like my own personal script for the lecture.
    </div>

    <h2>
        <strong> Day 1 - Getting Started </strong> <br>
        <i> 17.06.2024 </i>
    </h2>

    <p> The first thing is, of course, to set up your coding environment. For that, the following is needed:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b> capture phase: </b></li>
        <li><b> target phase:</b></li>
        <li><b> bubbling phase</b></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>
        <strong> Day 2 - HTML </strong> <br>
        <i> 18.06.2024 </i>
    </h2>

    <h2>
        <strong> Day 3 - CSS </strong> <br>
        <i> 19.06.2024 </i>
    </h2>

    <h2>
        <strong> Day 4 - Typescript</strong> <br>
        <i> 25.06.2024 </i>
    </h2>

    <p> Typescript is essentially a better version of Javascript, that compiles into Javascript.
        It allows for more strict type management, for example. This means that you have to be more specific
        with defining your variables, but also reduces the chance of errors due to conflicting data types.</p>

    <p> You can link scripts to your html-pages to change properties like texts and colors, creating objects and edit
        existing ones, allowing for <b>DOM-Manipulation</b> outside of the html-file.
    </p>

    <p> Scripts also handle interactions with the page, like clicking on something. These interactions are called
        <b>events</b>.
    </p>

    <p> For events to be called, an element needs an <b> Event Listener</b> (element.addEventListener("eventType",
        handlerFunction)).
        Those check for events they are assigned to and can call the appropiate function handling the event.
        Some examples of event types are:</p>

    <table style="width:50%">
        <tr>
            <th> Event Type</th>
            <th> Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td> PointerEvent</td>
            <td> Interactions with mouse/touchscreen/stylus, e.g. clicking</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td> KeyboardEvent </td>
            <td> Interactions with the keyboard, like single button presses</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td> WheelEvent</td>
            <td> Interactions with the mouse wheel</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>FocusEvent</td>
            <td>Occurs when elements lose or gain focus, by switching tabs for example</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>InvalidEvent</td>
            <td>Happens when an input is invalid</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>DragEvent</td>
            <td>When an element is dragged around with a pointer</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td> </td>
            <td> </td>
        </tr>

    </table>

    <p> Events are also divided int</p>
